<title>Bug #1016</title>
<h1>Annoying bug</h1>
<h2>So you've come to hear all about my daily pains?</h2>
<p>Basically, if you've seen my post on GameJolt, you know what's going on.</p>

<p>To sum it up, I screwed up big time. I'm honestly not sure what I did but I know what I shouldv'e done.</p>
<p>About 2 weeks ago, I tried to make these changes on 5b and that same thing happened. I used my backup from before I made any changes and I started over.</p>
<p>For some reason, I decided not to work on 5b and started the Game Thing project.</p>
<p>On Friday (Ooctober 16), I continued making 5b. When I started working, I constantly checked the text on the level map. But then I stopped checking every time. And then I just stopped checking. I think that I know what I'm doing wrong but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I'm going to try to set a deadine for myself: Sunday the 18th.</p>
