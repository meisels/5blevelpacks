        <h1>Annoying bug</h1>
        <h2>So you've come to hear all about my daily pains?</h2>
        <p>Basically, if you've seen my post on <a href="https://gamejolt.com/p/okay-new-update-i-have-a-bit-of-a-problem-as-you-can-see-in-the-pbqzjykq" target="_blank">GameJolt</a>, you know what's going on.</p>

        <p>To sum it up, I screwed up big time. I'm honestly not sure what I did but I know what I should've done.</p>
        <p>About 2 weeks ago, I tried to make these changes on 5b and that same thing happened. I used my backup from before I made any changes and I started over.</p>
        <p>For some reason, I decided not to work on 5b and started the Game Thing project.</p>
        <p>On Friday (Ooctober 16), I continued making 5b. When I started working, I constantly checked the text on the level map. But then I stopped checking every time. And then I just stopped checking. I think that I know what I'm doing wrong but I'm not sure.</p>
